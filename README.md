### Glad to see you here &nbsp; !

Hello! I'm Phoenix, I am one of three developers for RustyInfo Discord bot. Programming is something I do in my free time, I don't take it too seriously please don't send any hate xD. 

I am 16, and I am very inspired to work for the NYPD when I get older. I mainly play Rust & R6S, if there is anything you need help with on my page or just want to reach out you can add me on Discord @Phoenix#8033.
